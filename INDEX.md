- [L0001] parity-oracle (canonical) — reference prototypes update by file-drop and external ADR logs can collide with the local log; diff-verify, renumber/merge, headless-verify claims, fold into SPEC/ACCEPTANCE before goldens.
- [L0002] parity-oracle/swarm-dynamics — failing checks on a bit-parity port mean protocol mismatch, not port bugs; probe the reference, reproduce the measurement, or surface an erratum. Never adjust thresholds.
- [L0003] plugin-platform (canonical) — every new C++ tool target repeats the MSVC traps (M_PI, -O3, static-runtime mismatch). Bit THREE times; the knowledge was present each time and prevented nothing, because a checklist must be remembered. M_PI leg now GATED by `portability_gate` in ./verify fast; -O3 and runtime legs are still unguarded prose.
- [L0004] plugin-platform (canonical) — a filed PR branch is frozen, and a STACKED PR can silently merge into its already-merged base (GitHub doesn't retarget). New work = new branch off main; prefer un-stacked; verify the child reached origin/main after any merge. PRE-PUSH REFLEX: before pushing to any branch not created this turn, `gh pr view <branch>` must show OPEN (recurred 2026-07-22: 14 commits stranded on #70's merged branch). **A MERGED BADGE IS NOT EVIDENCE THE WORK IS IN MAIN** — it reports a PR closing against its OWN base, which may not be main; verify by content (grep main / `git merge-base --is-ancestor`), never by the badge or by the human's report (5th occurrence 2026-08-11: PR #261 merged into an already-consumed base; the F2 conformance tools were absent from main the same way).
- [L0005] plugin-platform/parity-oracle — duplicated key chains drift and symmetric lies pass value checks; single-source the maps, trust the audio-identity oracle.
- [L0006] plugin-platform — a wrapper's defaults are the host-facing surface: trace advertisement + inward event type + gating flags in the wrapper source (and look for its plugin-side extension seam) before claiming "host X delivers Y".
- [L0007] plugin-platform — "note doesn't stop" reports: exonerate core→shell→wrapper headlessly; AU wrapper forwards 0x90-vel-0 as NOTE_ON (shell must remap); fuzz timestamps drawn sorted or acausal orders fake hangs.
- [L0008] plugin-platform (canonical) — "host feature X doesn't work" can be a per-device HOST toggle (Live's MPE mode) or a stale scan-cache, not your code; verify host enablement + delivery mechanism before another code round. The concrete "gate elsewhere" branch of [L0006].
- [L0009] parity-oracle/plugin-platform (canonical) — external design/prior-art packets cite WRONG local ADR numbers, collide on ADR numbers, and claim absent features; grep every ADR cross-ref + scope claim against DECISIONS/SPEC/ROADMAP and web-verify citations before merging a triage. Extends [L0001].
- [L0010] plugin-platform (canonical) — CI costs money: macOS bills 10x, docs-only PRs shouldn't build, dedup push+PR triggers, put macOS post-merge-only; local ./verify full is the stronger gate. Long 'queued' on a public repo = account block, not strictness.
- [L0012] parity-oracle/swarm-dynamics — a parity failure can be the REGIME (chaos), not the port: 1-ULP-perturb the JS reference alone; if JS-vs-itself diverges as far as C++-vs-JS and grows, remove the golden and anchor behaviour where the effect is unmistakable. Never loosen ε. Refines [L0002].
- [L0013] parity-oracle/plugin-platform — lab→reference→core folds cross independent namespaces: grep the destination for every name AND enum index first (reach→harmReach; lab law 3 vs core tempo-grid 3 → law 5); record the mapping in the ADR + both law tables.
- [L0015] plugin-platform — a server started in the Bash sandbox is unreachable from the HUMAN's browser (the in-app pane is not evidence they can see it); for self-contained HTML just `open` the file. Also: never serve the repo root — it exposes .git.
- [L0016] parity-oracle/realtime-perf (canonical) — CALIBRATE THE DETECTOR: run any new defect metric on a known-clean signal (must read ~zero) and a known-bad one (must read large) BEFORE trusting it. Three instances in one session measured the signal instead of the defect; plausible rankings are not validation. ABSORBS L0014 (the spectral case: measure a weak residue where the strong signal structurally ISN'T — inter-harmonic midpoints — never as "total minus signal", which measures window leakage).
- [L0017] Detector calibration is per signal class — revalidate when the signal changes character | measurement, oracle, dsp, epistemics
- [L0018] A symmetric phase-warp axis is spectrally sign-blind — check before building dispersion on it | dsp, spectra, design, measurement
- [L0019] Humanised timing is CORRECTED error, not independent jitter — model mutual correction, expose the gain not the noise | timing, perception, humanize, midi, ensemble, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0020] A built artifact must display its own provenance — VCS-derived build stamp + dirty marker; load-time fingerprint where there's no build step | build, caching, provenance, debugging, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0022] A rejected best-effort push must be retried, never assumed delivered — retire state only on acceptance | api, realtime, events, plugins, debugging, doctrine
- [L0023] A param range widened without its UI control ships an INVISIBLE feature — no oracle sees it | interface, testing, oracle, gui, plugins, doctrine
- [L0024] A result landing right at its threshold means the DETECTOR is wrong, not that the fix is marginal | measurement, oracle, epistemics, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0025] A narrative decision log records WHY, not WHAT IS OPEN — keep a status index, updated atomically | docs, process, roadmap, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0026] A setup-time callback reaching FORWARD into uninitialised state fails silently and totally (JS temporal dead zone) — 5 occurrences; now GATED by `./verify fast` lab load check | javascript, gui, labs, debugging, tooling
- [L0027] **HIGH-PRIORITY (flagged for up-propagation):** infrastructure before instrument — audio context, routing, id namespace, preset format, coupling semantics, macro flags, display vocabulary all FIRST; cross-source axes freeze at first ship | architecture, sequencing, synth, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0028] **CANONICAL, HIGH-PRIORITY (flagged for up-propagation):** consumers address a ROLE resolved at read time, never an instance captured at wire time — one named indirection; the resolved instance must be LABELLED; a compatibility alias over a newly-multiplied resource (`core = cores[0]`) is the hazard that makes unported sites read as correct; partial fan-out means the port was done by call site, not by family | architecture, gui, viz, voice-lifecycle, indirection, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0029] **HIGH-PRIORITY (flagged for up-propagation):** performance gestures (velocity, pressure, tuning, bend) enter ONE routing layer and are distributed from it — a second hand-wired path for the same signal class is E x C silent chances to miss a connection, and a fan-out helper per family is honest but not the cure | architecture, mpe, modulation, routing, plumbing, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0030] An ORACLE is the most portable donation — it transfers the requirement without the implementation, so a library can build from scratch and still be held to behaviour paid for in real bugs; only true of oracles written against the PUBLIC surface and observable output | integrations, oracles, testing, library, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0031] **CANONICAL, HIGH-PRIORITY (flagged for up-propagation):** a reference oracle certifies AGREEMENT not correctness, and only over the surface the reference SPANS. Two blindnesses: (A) defects the reference SHARES are not missed but CERTIFIED; (B) anything outside its surface — the SHELL path an oracle skips by building the core directly, a SUPERSET range the reference lacks, or a LAYER downstream of what it renders — gets zero coverage from a green run. Pair fidelity oracles with invariant ones (no reference needed) and closed-form ones. The reference is a stage, not a fixture. ABSORBS L0011, L0021, L0034 | oracles, testing, parity, coverage, architecture, doctrine, cross-project
- [L0032] **CANONICAL, HIGH-PRIORITY (flagged for up-propagation):** a detector sharing an assumption with what it measures confirms whatever you expect — 4 instances in one day, each plausible and in the predicted direction; the cure has TWO halves and either alone is the trap — a control that MUST read zero, run against a FOREIGN corpus (your own fixtures share your blind assumptions) and paired with a corruption that must read non-zero; and every calibration mutation asserts its anchor | testing, calibration, epistemics, probes, doctrine, cross-project ALSO: asserting a plant's anchor proves the SOURCE changed, not the BINARY — a stale object makes a plant 'fire' exactly as predicted (3 occurrences); and when the subject is a REPORT not a signal, the control must be a negative assertion.
- [L0033] **CANONICAL:** a calibration plant that does NOT fire measured the assertion's coverage boundary — record it, never silently retry until one fires | testing, calibration, coverage, epistemics

- [L0035] **CANONICAL:** correct OUTPUT does not imply correct PROTOCOL — obligations to a consumer (lifecycle events, acks, cleanup) are a second observable surface with its own coverage; every path that can DISCARD an obligation is the thing to enumerate, and the cure is making the discharging path the only route | oracles, protocol, events, plugins, coverage, doctrine, cross-project

- [L0036] **CANONICAL:** PIN YOUR REFUSALS — a deliberate absence needs a test or it becomes an accidental presence; assert that the withheld operation has no route, that the deliberately-open case still validates, and that the uncovered boundary is named | testing, design, invariants, doctrine, cross-project

- [L0037] **CANDIDATE:** a correspondence artifact's frontmatter is a CLAIM about protocol state and the correspondent's git history is the FACT — a hand-maintained status field fails asymmetrically (a stale `open` costs a session, a stale `closed` costs a re-check), so ask the tree before reasoning from the letter | cross-project, protocol, provenance, doctrine, process

<!-- CONSOLIDATED 2026-08-11: 34 -> 30 entries. L0011/L0021/L0034 -> L0031 (they
     stated one claim four ways, which is a retrieval problem, not four lessons);
     L0014 -> L0016 (it always described itself as L0016's spectral case); L0003
     promoted canonical with its falsifier partly resolved by a real gate; L0004
     sharpened by a 5th occurrence. Retired IDs are tombstoned at the foot of
     LIBRARY.md and are never reused or renumbered. Next pass due at ~35. -->

- L0038 oracle coverage is per-transport; a reasoned exclusion still needs an owner (the dead pitch wheel)
- L0039 a check built against one sample inherits that sample's coincidences (FOUNDATIONS' row grammar + our readback aliasing, same week)
- L0040 meeting every acceptance criterion is not evidence the change did its job — measure the RESOURCE against an extracted baseline (the knobs that passed SS4 and bought 2%)
- L0041 `typeof x` does NOT guard a let/const — it throws in the TDZ, so the guard crashes in exactly the ordering it was written for
- L0042 "the fix didn't work" -> first prove the fix reached what was tested (install vs build mtime + `grep -a` marker in the installed binary)
- L0043 a subagent's summary is a claim about the tree, not the tree — read the primary source before ACTING on it (the seam answer filed from a scout's report)
- [L0044] Stacked PRs merge bottom-up or strand work on a corpse — verify tips with merge-base --is-ancestor
- [L0045] A running DAW keeps the old plugin image — verify the mapped inode or the in-GUI stamp, never the disk alone
- L0046 substring-anchored HTML cuts + tag-count-balance blindness → exact-line anchors; DOM parentage is the nesting oracle (tooling, editing)
- L0047 a compile-verified platform backend shares its sibling's NAMES, not its fixes; async-ready webviews drop early bind/setHTML silently — install from the ready callback, enumerate host hooks per backend (plugin-platform, gui)
- [L0048] Scratch artifacts are evidence only when namespaced per stream (verification · agents)
- [L0049] A scale that reaches into the integrator is a physics change in a view's clothes — one function downstream of the state makes bit-identity the gate (labs · oracles)
- [L0050] A draft filing in a sibling's tree turns our verify red — deliver as a PR on their repo, return their checkout to main (integrations · verify)
- [L0051] A background oracle's exit code is the wrapper's — chain the commit to the oracle in one shell line; grep the log for RED before git (verify · process)
- [L0052] A correctness sandbox is not a timing harness — vm globals cost ~56×; time in the main context, cite the tree an oracle ran on (labs · profiling)
- [L0053] A fresh worktree has empty submodules — `git submodule update --init --recursive` before cmake; say it in the brief (agents · build)
- [L0054] Re-baselining a reference-driven golden IS a protected reference edit + ADR — say so in the brief (parity · goldens)
- [L0055] Run and read a new check before calling its PR green; red-on-arrival is a finding, not a regression (oracles · review)
- [L0056] Worktree agents cannot chain `verify && git commit` — brief it as run / commit / re-run on the committed hash (agents · verify)
- [L0057] A spacing fix that loses the cascade looks applied and does nothing — scope it above the flow rule and verify the computed style served (gui · css · review)
- [L0058] Keyword fields are machine-read: put the bare word in the field and the prose in the body, reply under the original id, and suspect your own filing before the scanner (protocol · mailbox)
- [L0059] An acceptance criterion the lead writes can pass on the unfixed build — name the case where old and new differ, or it is decoration (briefs · oracles)
- [L0060] Record the row before dispatching, or the brief has nothing to quote and the ledger cannot disagree with it (process · briefs)
- [L0061] Parallel agents share one scratchpad and main's preview server — brief each its own subfolder and port (process · delegation)
- [L0062] A ruling must amend the agent charters that restate the old rule — the charter outranks the brief (harness · delegation)
- [L0063] A state oracle must RENDER — snapshot equality cannot see what the audio thread rewrites after a restore (oracles · history)
- [L0064] A view must be driven by what was rendered, not a parallel model or monitor instance — check drawn vs heard (labs · visualization)
- [L0065] A definition-changing ADR must state its scope and a gap-free transition, or it silently retires existing gates (decisions · oracles)
- [L0066] Node and Chrome are two numerical platforms (libm): key cross-runtime work to exact seeds and measure what plays (oracles · determinism)
- [L0067] Reading a private sibling ≠ permission to transcribe it: forbid copying in the brief and gate with an identifier scan (privacy · briefs)
- [L0068] A build-variant control must run the full scenario stream; subsets miss amplifier paths and under-report (oracles · ports)
- [L0069] A ruled-out hypothesis is scoped to the regime its control tested; slow effects hide behind fast controls (oracles · metrics)
- [L0070] Judge a cure on the curated bench too, not only on the sample that exposed the problem (oracles · evaluation)
- [L0071] A fingerprint pin is only as portable as the render is stable; probe with ULP perturbations before pinning (oracles · ci)
- [L0072] Per-scenario bit-exact share swings with 1-ULP nudges; gate on the mean share, per platform (oracles · parity)
- [L0073] A design lab can be a pinned golden; a metadata-only edit breaks whole-blob pins and verify fast cannot see it (oracles · labs · ci)
- [L0074] A folder move breaks every CMake cache, nested FetchContent sub-builds included; verify fast cannot see it (build · tooling · rename)
- [L0075] A new check cannot wait unwired or self-compile from tools/; discover-by-rule checks make parallel PRs order-dependent (gates · delegation · ratchets)
