/*
 * selftest.mjs — the behavioural half of enrolment: every enrolled adapter really
 * drives its engine, and the harness's own readings can be trusted. ROADMAP B448
 * phase 2, P2 (ADR-209). The static half is tools/engine_enrolment_check.py.
 *
 * NOT RUN BY ./verify YET. It needs the built render tool, and this package could
 * add neither a CMake target nor a compile line of its own (h2/harness/README.md,
 * "Wiring the selftest", says why and gives both ways to wire it). Until then it is
 * run by hand:
 *   node h2/harness/selftest.mjs --bin <path to h2_harness_render>
 *
 * It prints one PASS or FAIL line per row and exits 1 on any FAIL. The rows:
 *   LIST     the built binary's engine rows are exactly the registry's enrolled ids.
 *   FRESH    patches.json is what gen_patches.mjs generates from its sources today.
 *   patch    each reference patch of each enrolled engine, one note of the cell held
 *            for kSeconds: no unknown key, no non-finite sample, the pre-limiter bus
 *            maps back onto the output, and the patch's `expect` holds: `loud` is
 *            metrics.mjs's own silence rule read false AND at least LOUD_FLOOR_DB;
 *            `silent` is every sample exactly zero.
 *   NO-NOTE  MUST-READ-ZERO on the real engine: each loud patch with no note
 *            played renders exact zeros. Without it "loud" could be something the
 *            probe makes rather than the notes.
 *   CONTROLS (the judge must be able to say no):
 *     silent-adapter   the same loud job through control/silent, an adapter that
 *                      returns silence, must FAIL the must-read-loud judge. This is
 *                      the package's named must-fail control.
 *     loud-as-silent   a loud render must fail the must-read-silent judge.
 *     tone             control/tone has a level known in closed form: left reads
 *                      20 log10(0.5 / sqrt 2) dBFS, right is exactly half the left
 *                      sample by sample (a swapped or misaligned channel shows),
 *                      and after the release it is exact zeros.
 *     blocks           two rows, because either alone proves nothing. control/tone
 *                      is block-independent by construction, so its digest must be
 *                      the same at host blocks 1, 7, 128 and varying (a note lands
 *                      on its frame at any block size). control/block writes each
 *                      render call's length into its frames, so its output must
 *                      CHANGE with the block size, and must show exactly the cuts
 *                      the job language promises: without it the first row would
 *                      pass with the block size ignored. The engines' own
 *                      invariance is package P4's to judge, not this file's.
 *     digest           the same job twice gives the same digest, and different
 *                      patches give different ones (a constant digest shows).
 *     pre-limiter      the composed adapter's recovery read back at known values:
 *                      0 exactly, 3, 6 and 10 within a stated error, and the rail as
 *                      infinity; the tone control, which has no limiter, unchanged.
 *     refusal          a job for an adapter that does not exist, and a job with a
 *                      command the language does not have, stop the run. A job that
 *                      is quietly not run would read as a job that passed.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE THIS FILE'S THRESHOLDS (they are outside
 * docs/armor/tolerances.json, whose scan does not read .mjs files yet):
 *   LOUD_FLOOR_DB  -60 dBFS RMS. Measured 2026-10-10 on darwin-arm64: the quietest
 *                  loud patch (ledger/breathing-pad, a 1.5 s attack) read -28.0 dBFS
 *                  in this file's window, so the floor sits 32 dB under the quietest
 *                  patch and 30 dB over the -90 dBFS line metrics.mjs calls silence.
 *   TONE_TOL_DB    0.001 dB: the window holds a whole number of the tone's cycles.
 *   PRE_ROUNDTRIP  the measured errors (1.3e-15, 6e-13, 4.5e-9) with three decades
 *                  of room, because another platform's libm may round differently.
 *   PRE_MAP_TOL    1e-12: tanh(atanh(y)) differs from y by a few rounding steps.
 * No clock, no randomness: the same binary gives the same rows.
