# h2/harness — the engine harness

One interface for driving **any enrolled horde 2 engine** without knowing which
engine it is. The parameter fuzz, the invariance matrix and the soak (Blind-Spot
Armor phase 2, packages P3, P4 and P6) are each a loop over it.

ROADMAP B448, package P2, ruled in ADR-209. The proposal is
`docs/strategy/blind-spot-armor-phase2.md` (section 2 rule 4; section 3 row P2).

Last verified: 2026-10-10 (darwin-arm64, Apple clang, Node 24). Static check wired in
`./verify fast`; the selftest is green by hand and **not yet run by `./verify`**
(see "Wiring the selftest").

## What is here

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `harness.h` | The `Adapter` interface, the job language and its runner, and three control adapters. Includes no engine. |
| `adapter_composed.h` | The adapter for the composed engine (`h2/engine/`). States what the pre-limiter bus can and cannot say. |
| `adapters.h` | The table: one row per enrolled engine, then the controls. |
| `render_cli.cpp` | `h2_harness_render`: runs job files, writes what was rendered. Measures and judges nothing. |
| `harness.mjs` | The interface tools use: enrolled engines, reference patches, `render`, `features`. |
| `patches.json` | The reference patches. **Generated; never edit it by hand.** |
| `gen_patches.mjs` | Writes `patches.json` from the files that own each value. `--check` reports a stale file. |
| `selftest.mjs` | Proves each adapter drives its engine, with its must-fail controls. |

Beside it: `docs/armor/engines.json` (the enrolment registry) and
`tools/engine_enrolment_check.py` (the gate that finds un-enrolled directories).

## Using it (for the P3, P4 and P6 authors)

```js
import { enrolled, patchesFor, render, run, jobFor, patchCmds, features } from '../h2/harness/harness.mjs';

for (const engine of enrolled())                 // ids from docs/armor/engines.json
  for (const patch of patchesFor(engine)) {      // the reference patches of that engine
    const r = render({ patch, sr: 96000, block: 7, seed: 1, seconds: 2, hold: 1.5, pre: true });
    r.L; r.R;                                    // Float64Array: the output
    r.preL; r.preR;                              // Float64Array: the limiter's input
    r.summary.digest;                            // 16 hex digits over the output samples
    r.summary.unknownKeys;                       // keys the engine did not have
    const f = features(r, { from: 0.25, to: 1.25 });   // tools/patchspace/metrics.mjs
  }
```

A `render` request:

| field | meaning | default |
|---|---|---|
| `patch` | a reference patch, or its id | required unless `cmds` is given |
| `engine` | the adapter id | the patch's |
| `sr` | sample rate | 48000 |
| `block` | host block size in frames, or `{ vary: max }` for sizes drawn 1..max from a seeded stream | 128 |
| `seed` | the host random stream | 1 |
| `seconds` | total length | 1 |
| `hold` | seconds until the notes are released | held to the end |
| `notes`, `vel` | what is played | the cell's: the ledger's 8-voice chord at 0.85 |
| `overrides` | `{ key: value }` set after the patch and before `snap` | none |
| `pre` | also return the pre-limiter bus | false |
| `cmds` | your own script, replacing the default | none |

- **Many renders, one process.** `run([jobFor(a), jobFor(b), ...])` returns the results in
  order. Sixty 8-voice half-second jobs took 16 s on the dev Mac (measured 2026-10-10).
- **Your own script.** A fuzz that sweeps a parameter mid-note, or a soak that churns notes,
  passes `cmds`. The words are `set`, `sets`, `snap`, `on <note> <freq> <vel>`,
  `off <note>`, `panic` and `render <frames>` (`harness.h` has the full language). Start
  from `patchCmds(patch, overrides)` to get a reference patch as commands.
- **Block size never moves an event.** A `render` is cut into host blocks and the last one
  is shortened to fit, so a note or a `set` lands on its exact frame at any block size.
- **A bad request stops the run.** An unknown adapter or an unknown command makes `run`
  throw. Nothing is skipped: a job that did not run must never read as one that passed.
- **Determinism.** No clock, and no randomness but the seeded mulberry32 streams. The same
  job gives the same bytes from the same binary. Digests are keyed to the build that made
  them (`h2/README.md`), so compare them within one binary and pin none.
- **C++ in process.** Include `adapters.h`, call `makeAdapter(id)`, then either the adapter's
  own methods or `runJob(adapter, job, sink, info)`.

### The pre-limiter bus

The engine has no accessor for the value that enters its output limiter. Its last line is
`tanh(y * gain * 1.6)`, and tanh is one-to-one below its rail, so the adapter returns
`atanh(out)`: the limiter's input, after the gain and the DC blocker.

- **It is the real bus.** Checked once against the engine's own stage hook, which skips the
  limiter (a scratch build with `H2_ENGINE_STAGES`, the defaults patch, 8 voices, 1 s,
  2026-10-10): at gain 0.35 the bus peaked at 3.02 and the two agreed within 5.3e-15; at
  gain 1 it peaked at 8.63 and they agreed within 3.9e-10.
- **On the rail it reads infinity.** From about 19 the output is exactly 1 and the input is
  lost. Read `Infinity` as "at least 19", never as a number. In the same check at gain 8 (a
  value outside the declared range, used to force it) 13 % of the samples were on the rail.
- **Precision falls toward the rail:** 1.3e-15 at 3, 6e-13 at 6, 4.5e-9 at 10, 8e-5 at 15,
  0.13 at 18.5 (measured). A bound of a few units is tested exactly enough, and a blow-up
  reads as infinity, which no bound passes.
- A tool that needs more (the bus's true size far above 19, or the bus before the DC
  blocker) needs an engine accessor. This package was told not to add one.

### Features: what `tools/patchspace/metrics.mjs` has, and what it lacks

`features()` returns `metrics.mjs`'s `analyse()` bundle and adds nothing. The proposal
forbids a second metrics library (section 5).

| wanted (proposal, P2 and P4) | in `metrics.mjs` today |
|---|---|
| loudness | `rmsDb`, `peakDb`, `crestDb` at any rate. The K-weighted `lufs` is computed at 48 kHz only and is `null` at every other rate |
| spectral centroid | **missing** (`spectrum()` gives the power spectrum it would be computed from) |
| envelope | **missing** (no attack, release or envelope-shape measure; `rms()` over windows is all there is) |
| onset | **missing** (`clicks` finds one-off discontinuities, not an onset time) |
| pitch | partly: `rootPresence` and `rootInterval` say whether the played note wins, on a semitone grid. A frequency in Hz or cents is **missing** |
| also present | `nonFinite`, `dc`, `dcRatio`, `silent`, `clicks`, `flatness`, `noiseDb`, `roughness`; `aliasing()` and `aliasConvergence()` need a second render |

The missing ones are package P9's to add to `metrics.mjs`. P4's rate axis needs four of them.

## The reference patches

`patches.json` holds ten, all for `composed`. Each records where it came from.

- **Seven ledger presets** (`ledger/...`): the names are read from `kLedger` in
  `tools/measure_h2_engine.cpp`, the values from the bank
  (`reference/scalpel/data/presets.json`), played as the parity scenarios play them (the
  params, then gain 0.35). `ledger/defaults` is the engine with no preset.
- **Three corners** (`corner/...`), from the declared ranges in
  `tools/patchspace/dependency_tree.json`: every continuous parameter at its maximum; the
  same with every toggle on; every continuous parameter at its minimum. They are
  whole-table rules, so no parameter was chosen by judgement. Enumerations keep their
  defaults. The C++ engine declares defaults and no ranges, so that table (the lab's own)
  is the one declaration there is.
- **`expect`** is `loud` or `silent`. `corner/continuous-min` sets gain to 0 and must render
  silence: it is the set's must-read-zero patch.
- **The cell** is the ledger's 8-voice cell: `poly 8`, keys 48 + 3k, velocity 0.85.

Regenerate with `node h2/harness/gen_patches.mjs` after the bank, the ranges or the ledger
list changes.

## Building

`h2_harness_render` is h2 code, so every build is contraction-off (h2 rule 7). There is no
CMake target yet. By hand, from the repo root (3 to 8 s, measured):

```
c++ -std=c++20 -O3 -ffp-contract=off h2/harness/render_cli.cpp -o <dir>/h2_harness_render
```

`harness.mjs` looks for the binary in `run()`'s `bin` option, then `$H2_HARNESS_BIN`, then
`build-release/h2_harness_render`. On the ten reference patches the `-O2` and `-O3` builds
gave the same digests (measured 2026-10-10, this machine only).

## Wiring the selftest

`tools/engine_enrolment_check.py` is static and runs in `./verify fast`. `selftest.mjs`
needs the binary, and this package could not build one inside `./verify`:

- `CMakeLists.txt` was outside its brief, and
- a compile line in a `tools/` script is a `direct_compiles` entry of
  `tools/build_flags_check.py`, which only the human's approval can pin.

Two ways to close it, both small:

1. **In `./verify full`, with a CMake target** (no approval needed if the flags equal the
   class's; `tools/build_flags_check.py --append` records a new target):
   ```
   add_executable(h2_harness_render h2/harness/render_cli.cpp)
   target_compile_options(h2_harness_render PRIVATE -O3 -ffp-contract=off)   # inside the existing NOT MSVC guard
   ```
   then in `full()`, after the build: `node h2/harness/selftest.mjs --bin "$build_dir/h2_harness_render" || return 1`.
2. **In `./verify fast`**, by having the enrolment check compile the tool itself (measured
   in a draft of this package: 7.8 s the first time, 1.2 s after with a cached binary). That adds a
   `direct_compiles` entry, so it needs the human's approval.

Until one lands, "an adapter that returns silence is red" holds only when someone runs the
selftest. The enrolment check says so in its green line.

## Enrolling an engine or a module

A new directory under `h2/` that holds C or C++ code turns
`tools/engine_enrolment_check.py` red until it is in `docs/armor/engines.json`.

1. Write `h2/harness/adapter_<id>.h`: a class deriving `Adapter`, going through the
   engine's public interface only. Say in its header what `preLimiter()` can recover.
2. Include it in `adapters.h` and add its row: `{"<id>", false, &make<Name>},`.
3. Add the unit to `docs/armor/engines.json` with `kind`, `id` and `adapter`.
4. Give it reference patches. Teach `gen_patches.mjs` where they come from (every value read
   from a file that owns it), with at least one `expect: "loud"`.
5. Rebuild the tool and run the selftest.

A directory that is not an engine or a module is entered with `why_not_enrolled`. A
`test-reference` must not be included by anything enrolled; the check holds it to that.

## Known limits

- **A module has no input yet.** `Adapter::render` makes sound from notes. An effect needs
  input buffers, and no module exists under `h2/` to design that against, so it is not
  invented here. The first module's enrolment adds it.
- **Not exposed:** retune, the voice cap and its policy, the load readouts, per-voice
  state. No caller needs them yet. While a culled voice fades the engine passes its output
  through a float, which would lower the pre-limiter bus's precision; no harness render
  takes that path because the voice cap is not exposed.
- **Long renders.** The tool streams in chunks of 32768 frames with constant memory, but
  `harness.mjs` reads the whole output file at once. A four-hour soak needs a streaming
  reader on the JS side; the file format already allows one (each job's summary follows
  its samples).
- **The selftest's thresholds** (the loud floor, the tone tolerance, the pre-limiter
  tolerances) are in a `.mjs` file, which `docs/armor/tolerances.json`'s scan does not read
  yet. They are listed at the top of `selftest.mjs`.
