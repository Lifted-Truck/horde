"""engine_enrolment_check -- every engine and module under h2/ is in the harness.

WIRED: ./verify fast

WHY (B448 phase 2, package P2, ADR-209; armor row S5, "happy-path tests").
docs/strategy/blind-spot-armor-phase2.md section 2 rule 4: "A small registry lists
every engine and module under h2/. A new one turns R4, R5, R6, R9, R10 and S5 red
until it joins the harness." The fuzz, the invariance matrix and the soak loop over
the harness's enrolled engines, so an engine that is not enrolled is simply never
tested, and nothing would say so. This check is what says so.

WHAT IT DOES. It FINDS the units itself: every directory under h2/ that directly
holds a C or C++ file, tracked or new-and-not-ignored (`ls-files -co
--exclude-standard`; a brand-new directory is exactly the case). Nobody has to
remember to list one. Then, against docs/armor/engines.json:
  UNENROLLED  a found directory has no registry entry.
  STALE       a registry entry names a directory that holds no code.
  SHAPE       an entry is malformed: an unknown kind, a duplicate, an engine or
              module with no id or adapter, an exemption with no reason, or a
              `harness` entry that is not h2/harness.
  ADAPTER     an enrolled unit's adapter file is missing, is outside h2/harness/,
              or includes no file from the unit's own directory (an adapter that
              wraps something else enrols nothing).
  TABLE       the unit has no row in h2/harness/adapters.h, that file does not
              include its adapter, or the table has an engine row no entry owns.
  PATCHES     h2/harness/patches.json has no reference patch for the unit, none
              that is expected to be loud (must-read-loud would then test nothing),
              or a patch for an engine that is not enrolled.
  REFERENCE   a `test-reference` unit is included by an enrolled unit or by an
              adapter: it is product code after all and must be enrolled.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, AND WHERE THAT IS PROVED. This check is STATIC: it reads
files and builds nothing. It cannot tell an adapter that drives its engine from one
that returns silence. That is h2/harness/selftest.mjs's job: on the built render
tool it renders every reference patch of every enrolled engine and holds each to
its `expect`, with its own controls (an adapter that returns silence must FAIL
must-read-loud; each loud patch must read exact zero with no note played; a tone
of known level must read that level).
  THE SELFTEST IS NOT RUN BY ./verify YET, and this check's green line says so on
  every run. It needs a compiled binary, and this file may not build one: a compile
  line in a tools/ script is a `direct_compiles` entry of tools/build_flags_check.py,
  which only the human's approval can pin, and CMakeLists.txt was outside this
  package's brief. h2/harness/README.md gives the two ways to wire it.
Also not proved: a new engine entered as `test-reference` on the day it is created
is not caught unless something enrolled includes it. The registry is an approval
ledger and belongs under the same code-owner review as the others.

MUST-FAIL CONTROLS, every run (LIBRARY L0032: a probe must prove
it can go red). Each plants one fault in a copy of the tree's model, asserts the
plant changed it, and demands the matching verdict by name, once on a small
synthetic tree and once on the REAL one:
  a new engine directory with no entry (top level, under cores/, and two levels
  down); the engine's entry deleted; the engine relabelled `harness`; an unknown
  kind; its adapter missing; its adapter including nothing of the engine; its table
  row gone; a table row no entry owns; its patches gone; its loud patches gone; a
  patch for an unknown engine; a stale entry; an exemption with no reason; the
  engine including a test reference.
The conforming synthetic tree must read green (the must-read-zero: a judge that is
always red would pass every plant). One more control runs the DISCOVERY end to end
in a scratch repository: a staged directory, a new unstaged one, an ignored one and
one with no code must read as found, found, not found and not found.

Exit 0 green, 1 red. No clock, no randomness.
