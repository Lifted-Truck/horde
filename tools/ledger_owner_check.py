"""ledger_owner_check -- every approval ledger has a code owner, and acceptances.json is well formed.

UNWIRED: the lead wires this into ./verify in the Wave 1 wiring PR (B448, ADR-209)

WHY. A ratchet check (weakening, tolerance, parameter id, build flag, licence, self-digest) is only
as strong as who may approve into its ledger. ADR-209 item 3: only the human approves. The
mechanism is GitHub code-owner review: .github/CODEOWNERS names the human for each ledger, and the
main ruleset (the human's switch, not ours) requires that review. This check is the repo-side
guard: it cannot make GitHub enforce anything, but it is red when the ownership record and the
ledgers drift apart, so a new ledger cannot appear unowned.

WHAT IT CHECKS (all read the tracked tree; nothing is written).
  1. Every path in LEDGERS exists (a glob must match at least one tracked file) and its last
     matching CODEOWNERS rule names an owner (@handle).
  2. Every CODEOWNERS rule matches at least one tracked file, and matches ONLY ledgers: a rule
     naming a file that does not exist, or a catch-all `*`, is red ("only ledgers get an owner").
  3. No ratchet tool pins a file that is neither in LEDGERS nor in KNOWN_UNLISTED. The scan reads
     every string literal in tools/*.py that names a *.json whose basename looks like a pin
     (pin, lock, baseline, allowlist, tolerances, ledger, divergences, acceptances) and that
     basename is a tracked file. KNOWN_UNLISTED holds pinned files the human has not ruled on; each
     carries its reason and prints every run, so the question stays visible.
  4. docs/armor/acceptances.json is well formed: every entry has exactly id, row, kind, text,
     approved, expires; ids are unique; row is a catalogue.json row id; kind is accepted_limit or
     hole_expiry; approved and text are not empty; expires is an ISO date.
  EXPIRED entries print under their own heading and DO NOT fail the check: a date must never turn
  ./verify red by itself (the lead's dashboard handles expiry). `--today YYYY-MM-DD` sets the date
  compared against (default: the system date) so tests are deterministic.

MUST-FAIL CONTROLS (LIBRARY L0032), in memory on copies of the real text, every run, never
touching the repo's files: CODEOWNERS with one ledger's rule removed is red; CODEOWNERS with a
catch-all `*` added is red; a CODEOWNERS rule naming a missing file is red; a tool source pinning an
unlisted ledger-looking file is red; an acceptances entry missing `approved` is red; an entry with
a past `expires` is reported and still green; a fully valid entry is green; the untouched copies
are green. A control that does not behave as stated fails the run (the judge cannot be trusted).
