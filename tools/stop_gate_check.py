"""stop_gate_check — horde's contract test for the closing gate (B455 H2, B457, ADR-210).

WIRED: ./verify fast

The closing gate is what makes "a session cannot finish on unverified edits" true.
Since kit 2.9.0 the gate itself is kit-owned (`.kit/stop-gate.sh`, checksummed), and
`.claude/hooks/stop-gate.sh` is a short shim that runs it. The kit tests its gate in
its own repo. This check tests what is horde's: that OUR shim, with OUR vendored
files, blocks in OUR repo. It runs the real shim, the real vendored gate and the real
`record` function in scratch git repositories against a table of situations, each
with the verdict it must give. 0 allows the stop, 2 blocks it.

Every record below is written by the kit's own `record`, never by hand, so the
fingerprint in it is the one a real `./verify` would write.

Self-calibrating, with two faulty hooks run against the same table:
  - a hook that never blocks must get every block row wrong;
  - our shim with its `KIT_STOP_GATE_MODE=deny` line removed must get exactly the
    tree-state rows wrong. That line is the one thing horde adds to the kit's
    default (ADR-210 item 2), so this proves the line is what makes those rows block.

History: until kit 2.9.0 this file tested horde's own gate, which compared file
times. Its LIMIT row (a file deleted after verify was not seen) is a block row now.

# a later second (60 of 60 allowed). The fingerprint works on a copy of the index, and
# the copy's fresh time makes git trust the recorded size and time. With same-size
# edits this table passed or failed by the clock. The finding and a tested one-word fix
# are filed with the kit (thread stop-gate-tree-state); the kit owns that file.
