"""build_flags_check -- the compiler and linker flags that decide numerics and safety are PINNED
(B448 C2, ADR-197 risk row 11: build/platform divergence).

WIRED: ./verify fast (static, from the sources); ./verify full adds --built (the configured tree).

WHY. One stray -ffast-math licenses the compiler to assume no NaN and no inf, folds away the
very tests that guard the output, and reassociates sums so a parity golden stops meaning
anything -- while every test still "passes" because the tests were compiled under it too. One
changed -O level or -ffp-contract moves bits (h2's whole parity story is contraction-off, ruled
2026-09-30). Review does not see a flag in a 1100-line CMakeLists. A diff against a pin does.

WHAT ALREADY EXISTED, AND WHAT THIS ADDS. tools/h2_rules_check.py rule 2 enforces that every
target compiling h2 code carries -ffp-contract=off (and the two FMA controls =fast). It does not
look at the legacy plugin, the -O level, fast-math, sanitizers, the C++ standard, the deployment
target, build types, or compiler lines outside CMake, and a flag changed on a target it does not
classify passes it. This file pins ALL of them and defers contraction-on-h2 to that rule (not
duplicated: the pin merely also records the flags it demands, so removing one is a pin diff).

THE PIN. tools/build_flags_pin.json records, extracted STATICALLY from CMakeLists.txt (no
configure, no network, ~0.1 s):
  global         every set(CMAKE_*), add_compile_options/add_link_options/... : the C++ standard,
                 deployment target, architectures (UNSET today: native only), MSVC runtime. Any
                 NEW global flag setter is a diff.
  classes        per target, the explicit compile and link options and the condition they sit
                 under (NOT MSVC, x86_64...), grouped as legacy_plugin / h2_parity / h2_product /
                 h2_fma_control / tools_oracles. Optimisation level, -ffp-contract, -mfma etc. are
                 all just flags here. A removed or new target is a diff.
  dynamic_loops  the sanitizer and MSVC-stack loops that stamp flags on "every executable
                 declared so far": the flags and WHICH executables they reach.
  entry_points   the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE / HYPERSAW_SANITIZE each script and workflow configures with.
  direct_compiles  flags of compiler lines outside CMake (tools/*.py, *.sh, workflows).
Not pinned, and why: -DNDEBUG, -O3 and -arch come from CMake's Release defaults, not from any
file here (the entry point's build type is what is pinned); clap-wrapper's own targets get their
flags from libs/. `--built <build-dir>` reads the configured tree's flags.make to check those.

ALSO CHECKED EVERY RUN, with no pin involved: every add_executable is reached by the HYPERSAW_SANITIZE
loop AND the MSVC /STACK loop (sanitizer_reach_gaps; B454 items 1 and 8 -- each loop stamps "executables
declared so far", and 12 sat below them, never instrumented and left on the default 1 MB Windows stack).
Both loops are LAST in CMakeLists.txt for that reason. Also: no member of the fast-math family (see FASTMATH)
appears as a code token in CMakeLists.txt, cmake/, verify, tools/*.sh, tools/*.py or the
workflows (comments and docstrings are blanked first: nan_latch_check.py names the flag in a
comment). And -ffp-contract=fast/on may only sit on a target named *_fma_control.

MODES. (none) check;  --init first pin;  --append add NEW targets whose flags equal their
class's (never alters an entry; refuses anything else);  --approve <target|section> <ref>  a HUMAN-approved
re-pin of one item to the tree (non-empty <ref> recorded; refused while fast-math is present);
--built <dir>  also read <dir>/CMakeFiles/*/flags.make.
SELF-CALIBRATING: selftest() plants an executable below the sanitizer loop, one below the /STACK loop only, each loop
moved back mid-file and each loop absent (all red), an executable above it, bare or under if() (no gap), and plants -ffast-math (and each sibling), a changed -O level, a changed
-ffp-contract, a removed target, a new global flag, a new target and an empty approval ref on
COPIES of the real sources; each must read red / be refused, and the untouched copy must read green.
